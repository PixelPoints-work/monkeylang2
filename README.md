Educational Go Interpreter Project This repository contains my code as I follow along with Thorsten Ball's excellent book, "Writing an Interpreter in Go". My goal is to deepen my understanding of interpreters through hands-on practice.

Important Notes

This work may contain partial implementations or sections from the book. This is not an official representation of the book's content. About "Writing an Interpreter in Go"

Thorsten Ball's book guides you through the process of building a working interpreter for the Monkey programming language. It's a fantastic resource for learning about compilers, interpreters, and programming language design.

Practice for Github.

My second attempt after getting more programming experience.
